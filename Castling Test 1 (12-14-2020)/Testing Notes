CASTLING (Rook and King Test)

1. Attempt to use the doCastling method using whiteKing and whiteRook1. [Successful]
    Rook whiteRook1 = new Rook(0,0,"White Rook 1", true);
    King whiteKing = new King(4,0,"King",true);
    testPieces.add(whiteRook1);
    testPieces.add(whiteKing);
    whiteKing.validCastling(testPieces, whiteRook1);
    whiteKing.doCastling(testPieces,whiteRook1);

2. Test to make sure the castling does not work with an already moved King or Rook. [Successful]
    whiteKing.moveTo(3,0,whiteKing,testPieces);
    whiteKing.validCastling(testPieces, whiteRook1);
    whiteKing.doCastling(testPieces,whiteRook1);
    whiteRook1.print();

3. Works properly for both black and white pieces (rook 1). [Successful]

4. Works for Rooks on both side of the king. (Tests conducted separately) [Not Successful]
    ok, so I tried using this method for both the Rooks on both sides of the kings in separate tests (black and white)
    It seems to work properly for the Rook that on one of the sides that is 4 spaces away from the king
    but not does work for the Rook that is 3 spaces away on the other side.
    The tests were conducted separately so with each new test, I made sure they qualified to make this move.

    I used the following tests:
    I placed white rook 1 and 2 at (0,0) and (7,0)
    I placed black rook 1 and 2 at (0,7) and (7,7)
    The white king and black king were placed at (4,0) and (7,0)
    OUTPUT:-
    Test 1: The castling was working properly when I used it between rook 1 and king (for both colors).
    Test 2: However, it would not work when I use Rook 2 and king (for both colors).

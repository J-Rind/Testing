Knight Test 1


1. Can successfully create pieces objects. (CORRECT)
    Created two white and two black KNIGHT pieces objects.
            Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
            Knight whiteKnight2 = new Knight(6,0,"WhiteKnight2",true);
            Knight blackKnight1 = new Knight(1,7,"BlackKnight1",true);
            Knight blackKnight2 = new Knight(6,7,"BlackKnight2",false);

2. When the knight was created, the range is NOT set correctly since the movements don't function as intended (NON FUNCTIONAL)

    Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
    whiteKnight1.moveTo(2,2,whiteKing,testPieces);

    The above code should move the Knight to the location but it fails.
    I tried using other coordinates for other Knights as well but they failed to function correctly.

3. Unable to test if the piece can jump over other pieces (NON FUNCTIONAL)
    Since the knight is unable to move, can not confirm if it works as intended.

I will conduct another test if there is an update in the code or once I receive more details.
    For now, the knight doesn't move as intended.
    In fact, I even tried using INCORRECT coordinates for a knight such as only one step forward but it still fails to move.

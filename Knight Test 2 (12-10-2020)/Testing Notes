Knight Test 1

1. Can successfully create pieces objects. (CORRECT)
    Created two white and two black KNIGHT pieces objects.
            Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
            Knight whiteKnight2 = new Knight(6,0,"WhiteKnight2",true);
            Knight blackKnight1 = new Knight(1,7,"BlackKnight1",true);
            Knight blackKnight2 = new Knight(6,7,"BlackKnight2",false);

2. When the knight was created, the range is set correctly and the movements function as intended(CORRECT)

    Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
    whiteKnight1.moveTo(2,2,whiteKing,testPieces);

    I tried using other coordinates for other Knights as well and were successful.

3. Test if the piece can jump over other pieces (SEMI FUNCTIONAL)
    Ok, so this one is a little complicated.
    If a white piece jumps over another piece and tries to go back to its initial location it works.
    If a black piece tries to do just the same, it fails.
    I used the following coordinates:-
            Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
            Knight whiteKnight2 = new Knight(6,0,"WhiteKnight2",true);
            Knight blackKnight1 = new Knight(1,7,"BlackKnight1",false);
            Knight blackKnight2 = new Knight(6,7,"BlackKnight2",false);
            Pawn blackPawn1 = new Pawn(6,6,"BlackPawn1",false);
            Pawn whitePawn1 = new Pawn(1,1,"WhitePawn1",true);
            // All of the above pieces were then added to the array.

            Now when the white Knight 1 tries to jump over the white pawn 1 and move to (2,2) and back to (1,0), it is successful
            But when the black Knight 2 tries to jump over the black pawn 1 and move to (5,5) and back to (6,7), is is NOT successful.
            However, the same black knight 2 is able to make those movements without the black pawn 2 existing.

            Please check this further and let me know if you make any changes.

4. Tested to see if the knight can not move to invalid coordinates. (CORRECT)

I will conduct another test if there is an update in the code or once I receive more details.

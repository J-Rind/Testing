1. Can not create object Board. (even after adding a piece class to the project)

2. Board does not function properly due to there not being a default constructor in Square class.
    Example:- public Square() { }
    This would fix the initial errors related to the square class within the board class.

2. The board is not displayed in proper format.

3. ShowBoard() method displays the piece object but not in proper format.
    It should be calling a getName() method from the piece class to display the name of that specific piece.
    Example:- System.out.println(squares[x][y].getPiece().getName());

4. When the getName method is used, it causes a NullPointerException.
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.NullPointerException
    	at com.company.Board.showBoard(Board.java:208)
    	at com.company.Main.main(Main.java:7)
    This is caused because the getName method does not work for pieces whose value is null.

5. BUG in the setFront and setBack methods in the board class within the for loops.
    Currently, the loops in both the methods has the conditions (y=1,y<2,y++).
    To properly assign values it should be (y=0, y<8, y++) to assign to eight objects in one row.

6. Following the notes above should fix most of the bugs, however, the list(board) still prints in a vertical format instead of 8 rows and 8 columns.
    This can be easily fixed by using 'print' instead of 'println' in line 208 of the showBoard() method within the Board class

7. Even though the arrays are of size [8][8], there is no error handling in case the user tries to move to a nonexistent value such as [12, 52].
    It should only allow users to move within the board to avoid the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
    This error usually occurs while using setPieceOnSpace() or removePieceOnSquare() methods.
    This can be fixed by adding an if statement similar to if(x<0 or x>7) { throw error message} else { // Do whatever the user wants };

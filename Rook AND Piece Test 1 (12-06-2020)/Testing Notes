Piece AND Rook test 1

1. The board is creating the Piece object for units such as Rook, knight, etc. instead of creating a Rook object from the Rook class that inherits from the Piece class.

2. No piece.getName() AND piece.setName() methods in the piece class. These methods are called several times within the board class.
    Related to point number 1. The pieces and board class are taking two different approaches to creating pieces.
    Board class is creating pieces by creating a piece object and using a .setName() method.
    While the pieces are designed to be created using their own classes such as Rook.java and objects intended to be created using coordinates and colors.

3. ERROR in current state partially due to the piece class being an abstract class and the getRange function being abstract as well but not implemented by the board yet.

4. Did not see a way for the board class to print the pieces objects.

5. The board class seems to create two different arrays for Black and White pieces.
    However, the pieces class/Rook is designed to add all pieces into a single array and add an extra field to the Piece/Rook object that determines if the piece is white.
    It is a Boolean value for white. white = true for white and white = false for black.

6. The piece class has a field isAlive that determines if the piece is still on the board.
    The board class simply removes the piece and have no method that sets a piece to isAlive = true or false

# See Testing Notes within Folders for details
Each test conducted will be in a seperate folder with its own set of notes included within the file Testing Notes.
A new folder will be created ONLY if the code in the different classes has gone through major changes. Minor changes will just be edited to and added to an existing folder with updated testing notes.

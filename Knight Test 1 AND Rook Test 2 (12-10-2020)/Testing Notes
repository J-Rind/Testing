Knight Test 1

1. Can successfully create pieces objects. (CORRECT)
    Created two white and two black KNIGHT pieces objects.
            Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
            Knight whiteKnight2 = new Knight(6,0,"WhiteKnight2",true);
            Knight blackKnight1 = new Knight(1,7,"BlackKnight1",true);
            Knight blackKnight2 = new Knight(6,7,"BlackKnight2",false);

2. When the knight was created, the range is NOT set correctly since the movements don't function as intended (NON FUNCTIONAL)

    Knight whiteKnight1 = new Knight(1,0,"WhiteKnight1",true);
    whiteKnight1.moveTo(2,2,whiteKing,testPieces);

    The above code should move the Knight to the location but it fails.
    I tried using other coordinates for other Knights as well but they failed to function correctly.

3. Unable to test if the piece can jump over other pieces (NON FUNCTIONAL)
    Since the knight is unable to move, can not confirm if it works as intended.

I will conduct another test if there is an update in the code or once I receive more details.
    For now, the knight doesn't move as intended.
    In fact, I even tried using INCORRECT coordinates for a knight such as only one step forward but it still fails to move.
	
	The pawns I created to test the Knight Jump has similar issues. 



Rook Test 2

1. Can successfully create Rook Pieces. (CORRECT)
    Created two white and two black Rook pieces objects.
            Rook whiteRook1 = new Rook(0,0,"White Rook 1", true);
            Rook whiteRook2 = new Rook(7,0,"White Rook 2", true);
            Rook blackRook1 = new Rook(0,7,"Black Rook 1", false);
            Rook blackRook2 = new Rook(7,7,"Black Rook 2", false);

2. When the rook is created, the range is NOT set correctly since the movements don't function as intended (NON FUNCTIONAL)

    // Expected to move (not working)
            whiteRook1.moveTo(0,3,whiteKing,testPieces);
            blackRook1.moveTo(3,7,blackKing,testPieces);
            blackRook1.moveTo(0,5,blackKing,testPieces);

3. Unable to test if the pieces is restricted from jumping over pieces (NON FUNCTIONAL)
    Since the rook is unable to move, can not confirm to make sure the Rook is unable to jump over other pieces.
    Also tried using INCORRECT coordinates for testing purposes but no movement found.
    The issue might possibly be with the range function not working properly.
	
I will conduct another test if there is an update in the code or once I receive more details.

1. Board Test Code as provided by the Board team:

        Board myBoard = new Board();
        ArrayList<Piece> myList = new ArrayList<>();
        myList = myBoard.showBoard();

        System.out.println();
        for (Piece p: myList){
            System.out.println (p.getName());

        }

2. Board and Pieces on the Board print out successfully

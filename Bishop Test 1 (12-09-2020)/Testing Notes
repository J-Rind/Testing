Bishop Test 1


1. Can successfully create pieces objects. (CORRECT)
    Created two white and two black bishop pieces objects.

2. When the bishop was created, the range is successfully set so it can only move to valid coordinates (CORRECT)
    Tested the white piece object (5,0) by moving it to an invalid coordinate (5,1), the piece was unable to move which is perfect.

3. Tested to make sure the bishop is restricted from jumping over other pieces (CORRECT)
    // Attempt to create conflicting moves (also checking if the piece can jump)
            blackBishop2.moveTo(7,2,blackKing,testPieces);
            whiteBishop1.moveTo(6,1, whiteKing, testPieces);
            blackBishop2.moveTo(5,0,blackKing,testPieces);

            whiteBishop1.moveTo(4,1, whiteKing, testPieces);
            blackBishop2.moveTo(5,0,blackKing,testPieces);
            whiteBishop1.moveTo(5,0, whiteKing, testPieces);

4. Tried to destroy a piece using another piece but it was unsuccessful (NON FUNCTIONAL)
    whiteBishop1.moveTo(5,0, whiteKing, testPieces);
    blackBishop2.moveTo(7,2,blackKing,testPieces);
    blackBishop2.moveTo(5,0,blackKing,testPieces);
            whiteBishop1.print();
            blackBishop2.print();

    Even though the moves were successful, the isAlive status for both the pieces remained 'true' instead of one being 'false'
    Not sure if the isAlive status is to be determined by another class or not.

Everything else with the bishop class seems to be working fine. See Main.java to see how the tests were conducted.

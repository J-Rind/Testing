Board test 2:
1. No exception handling for users trying to remove a piece from a space that doesn't exist
   Throws an array index out of bounds exception
   Even though the arrays are of size [8][8], there is no error handling in case the user tries to move to a nonexistent value such as [12, 52].
       It should only allow users to move within the board to avoid the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
       This error usually occurs while using setPieceOnSpace() or removePieceOnSquare() methods.
       This can be fixed by adding an if statement similar to if(x<0 or x>7) { throw error message} else { // Do whatever the user wants };

2. All other bugs from Board test 1 seems to have been fixed.

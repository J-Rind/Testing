Findings from walk-through lecture + more regarding Board's main branch (11-23-20 ~6:00 PM):

Although there is no expected outcome handed to us directly, we were expecting board.showBoard()
to look like something along the line of the Checkers example:

__R0-0___0-1____R0-2___0-3____R0-4___0-5____R0-6___0-7__
__1-0____R1-1___1-2____R1-3___1-4____R1-5___1-6____R1-7_
__R2-0___2-1____R2-2___2-3____R2-4___2-5____R2-6___2-7__
__3-0____3-1____3-2____3-3____3-4____3-5____3-6____3-7__
__4-0____4-1____4-2____4-3____4-4____4-5____4-6____4-7__
__W5-0___5-1____W5-2___5-3____W5-4___5-5____W5-6___5-7__
__6-0____W6-1___6-2____W6-3___6-4____W6-5___6-6____W6-7_
__W7-0___7-1____W7-2___7-3____W7-4___7-5____W7-6___7-7__



Instead, this is the output of the current code:

Major issues with the unmodified output and code:

- Setting the front and back rows of the board is incorrect
- It does not output the names of the piece as expected
---> Also, if piece.getName() is called on a null piece like above, an error occurs if other errors aren't accounted for
- the output of each name is on a separate line; it doesn't match the format as expected


Other issues/possible issues:
- No error handling is made when removing or placing a piece on unexpected square coordinates; it's hardcoded to only
  expect an x and y value between 0-7

- No default constructor has been made for the Square class; the 2D array is then unable to create empty Squares without
  parameters on Line 30 of Board.java

- What is the use for the ArrayLists blackPiece and whitePiece?
--> Since the default constructor for Board calls setBoard(), the ArrayList could have duplicate pieces added to it if
    the board is set manually once more
--> When pieces are removed from the board, they still exist in the ArrayList as well if it will be used

- (Formatting inconsistency/preference) Are blank spaces supposed to be surrounded by Underscores(_) or hyphens (-)
  unlike regular pieces which are surrounded by a hyphen(-)

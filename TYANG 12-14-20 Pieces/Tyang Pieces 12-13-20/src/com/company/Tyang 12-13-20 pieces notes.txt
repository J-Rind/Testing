TYANG 12-13-20 Pieces castling notes

NOTE: Pawn is modified to work in my project

Castling Notes:

- If a King attempts to move into a check against a Pawn the move occurs
    -> Rook is fully moved to Castling position, King is moved back as a check is spotted
    -> Although Rook is fully moved to the Castling position, it's pMove isn't incremented, only the King's
    -> noticed that the King's pMove will not increment if move is blocked (not valid range)
    -> noticed that the King's range will show this checked castling move as valid (appears in range)



Things to note that do not regard the castling:

- Although I'm not officially in charge of the pieces, there are issues with the Pawn still
    -> the issue was similar to the Knight pieces only sending in their own coordinates on 2nd+ moves
    -> ALSO condition is incorrect for Black Pawn moving down 1

    -> Pawns do not have the option to attack on their first move as well

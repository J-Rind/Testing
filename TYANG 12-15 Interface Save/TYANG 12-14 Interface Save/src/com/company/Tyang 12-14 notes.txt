SOLVED ISSUES
** Unable to run code, even if obtaining files as a Zip (errors pulling from origin on my end since I pressed push by mistake)

Steps taken:
    - removed duplicate class Players.java
    - removed isCheckMate (causing errors, might only be on my end since it appears only on my GitHub folders)

Uppercase + Lowercase issues
    - fixed GameSaver -> gameSaver
    - fixed XmlDecoder -> XMLDecoder
    - fixed savedGame -> SavedGame

takeTurn issues:
    - fixed gameSaver.SavedGame -> gameSaver.savedGame
        -> swapped to pass player, not this.player.getName()
        -> swapped around whitePlayer -> playerWhite   and blackPlayer -> playerBlack

Understood that some of it is old code -> modified some of it to allow for some movements

ISSUES :
    -- MOST ISSUES = NEED TO FOLLOW JAVA BEANS RULES FOR XML

        -> getters AND setters required for object
        -> implements Serializable
        -> empty constructor required

    -> Issues reside on the Pieces side as well -> same format required for Piece
        -> Piece constructors need to be public
        -> Piece needs to implement Serializable
            -> all pieces require an empty constructor
        -> Piece class needs default getters and setters (alt+insert -> added 3 more generated get/set methods)

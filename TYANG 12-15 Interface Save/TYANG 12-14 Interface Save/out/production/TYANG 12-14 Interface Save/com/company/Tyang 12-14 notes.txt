Tyang 12-14-20 Interface saving

** Unable to run code, even if obtaining files as a Zip (errors pulling from origin on my end since I pressed push by mistake)

Steps taken:
    - removed duplicate class Players.java
    - removed isCheckMate (causing errors, might only be on my end since it appears only on my GitHub folders)

Uppercase + Lowercase issues
    - fixed GameSaver -> gameSaver
    - fixed XmlDecoder -> XMLDecoder
    - fixed savedGame -> SavedGame

takeTurn issues:
    - fixed gameSaver.SavedGame -> gameSaver.savedGame
        -> swapped to pass player, not this.player.getName()
        -> swapped around whitePlayer -> playerWhite   and blackPlayer -> playerBlack

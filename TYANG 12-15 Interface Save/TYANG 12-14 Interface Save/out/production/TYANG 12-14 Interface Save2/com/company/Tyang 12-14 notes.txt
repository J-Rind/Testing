Tyang 12-14-20 Interface saving

** Unable to run code, even if obtaining files as a Zip (errors pulling from origin on my end since I pressed push by mistake)

Steps taken:
    - removed duplicate class Players.java
    - removed isCheckMate (causing errors, might only be on my end since it appears only on my GitHub folders)

Uppercase + Lowercase issues
    - fixed GameSaver -> gameSaver
    - fixed XmlDecoder -> XMLDecoder
    - fixed savedGame -> SavedGame

takeTurn issues:
    - fixed gameSaver.SavedGame -> gameSaver.savedGame
        -> swapped to pass player, not this.player.getName()
        -> swapped around whitePlayer -> playerWhite   and blackPlayer -> playerBlack

Understood that some of it is old code -> modified some of it to allow for some movements

ISSUES : If not empty default constructor in SavedGame.java = InstatiationException
-> FOUND solution just as a heads up since this regards XML and JavaBeans standards
    -- MOST ISSUES = NEED TO FOLLOW JAVA BEANS RULES

        -> getters AND setters for each
        -> implements Serializable
        -> empty contructor4

The game will load, but no movements will have been saved if these requirements have been implemented
    -> also, loading at the moment does not have any form of error checking/catching for wrong files

    -> I believe the issue is on the pieces side as they implemented Abstract classes that Override a few methods
        -> Pawn, King, and Rook will cause errors to show up
